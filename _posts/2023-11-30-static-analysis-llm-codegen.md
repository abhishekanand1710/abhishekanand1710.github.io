How useful is LLM generated code? Can we automatically evaluate generated code for common errors without unit tests? We utilize static code analyzers (unlike unit tests, they don't require code execution and can be run on any code in the wild) for automatic evaluation of LLM generated code and show their efficacy as a feedback engine to LLMs to correct common static errors to generate syntactically correct and useful code.
