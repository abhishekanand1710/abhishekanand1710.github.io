Is there a relation between hard-to-learn samples and annotator disagreement for language models? Does discarding minority votes lead to a biased perspective? Can multi-annotator models learn valuable information from minority votes that are generally discarded as noise during aggregation? We answer these questions by training standard single ground truth (RoBERTa-base) and multi-annotator (DisCo) models and evaluate prediction confidence using Dataset Cartography.
